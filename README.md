# KerSplash

This is a small WPF project that displays a splash screen with a Bongo Cat image that animates along with your keystrokes.

**How it works**

The KerSplash application creates a splash screen that displays an image of a Bongo Cat. When you press a key, the application simulates a tapping animation on the Bongo Cat's paw.

**Features**

* Simple and easy to use
* Fun and attention-grabbing splash screen
* Toggles to place splash screen on random or specific location
* Chaos mode for when you want a lot of splash screens
* rudimentary multi-monitor support (needs more work)

**Requirements**

* .NET Framework

**Getting started**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Run the application.
